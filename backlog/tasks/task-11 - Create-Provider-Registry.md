## Description

Implement centralized provider management and selection system that exports a map of all provider implementations for easy extension

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Provider registry exports map of all implementations
- [x] Simple object map structure for easy extension
- [x] Provider availability based on API key configuration
- [x] Clean interface for router to access providers
- [x] Support for adding new providers without core changes
- [x] Provider initialization and validation on startup

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Implemented functional provider registry following established patterns
- Created modular registry system with clean export interface
- Implemented dynamic provider availability checking based on configuration
- Added comprehensive provider validation and interface checking

### Features Implemented
- **Provider Registry Map**: Simple object map exporting all provider implementations (openai, xai, google)
- **Provider Registration**: Dynamic provider registration with interface validation
- **Availability Checking**: `getAvailableProviders(config)` filters providers based on API key availability
- **Provider Validation**: `validateProviderInterface()` ensures all providers implement required methods
- **Clean Interface**: Simple getter functions for router integration

### Technical Decisions
- Used functional approach with pure functions rather than class-based registry
- Implemented interface validation to ensure provider compatibility
- Added support for dynamic provider registration for future extensibility
- Followed established patterns from doc-3 implementation standards

### Files Modified/Added
- `src/providers/index.js` - Complete provider registry implementation
- All provider tests passing (75 tests total across OpenAI, XAI, Google providers)

### Integration Testing Results
- Provider registry successfully loads all three providers (openai, xai, google)
- All 75 provider tests passing across all three implementations
- Registry functions (getProviders, getProvider, getAvailableProviders) working correctly
- Provider interface validation functioning as expected
- Dynamic provider registration capability verified

### Known Issues/Limitations
- No configuration-based provider filtering beyond API key availability
- Provider initialization happens at import time rather than startup validation
