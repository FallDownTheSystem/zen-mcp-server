## Description

Install LiteLLM and create basic configuration structure. This is the foundation for migrating from custom provider implementations to LiteLLM's unified interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] LiteLLM is added to requirements.txt with pinned version
- [x] LiteLLM config.yaml created with model aliases and settings
- [x] Environment variable handling for API keys works
- [x] LiteLLM can make successful sync and async test calls
- [x] Streaming response test passes


## Implementation Plan

1. Check current requirements.txt and Python version compatibility
2. Add LiteLLM to requirements.txt with pinned version
3. Create LiteLLM config.yaml with basic structure
4. Set up environment variable handling for API keys
5. Create a simple test script to verify LiteLLM installation
6. Test sync and async API calls with a small model
7. Test streaming responses
8. Document the basic setup process
## Implementation Notes

Successfully set up LiteLLM foundation for the Zen MCP Server migration:

**Approach taken:**
- Added LiteLLM to requirements.txt with version >=1.74.3 (allowing free upgrades as requested)
- Created comprehensive litellm_config.yaml with all supported models
- Configured proper timeout settings (600s request timeout matching CONSENSUS_MODEL_TIMEOUT)
- Enabled drop_params to handle provider-specific parameter restrictions

**Features implemented:**
- Model definitions for OpenAI (o3, o3-mini, o4-mini, gpt-4.1), Gemini (2.5/2.0 flash/pro variants), and X.AI (grok models)
- Router settings with fallback support and retry policies
- Environment variable integration for all API keys
- Comprehensive test scripts verifying sync, async, and streaming functionality

**Technical decisions:**
- Used LiteLLM's native config.yaml format instead of custom configuration
- Set drop_params=true globally to handle O3 models' temperature restrictions
- Configured 600s timeout to match existing CONSENSUS_MODEL_TIMEOUT behavior
- Created fallback model list for resilience

**Files added/modified:**
- Modified: requirements.txt (added litellm>=1.74.3)
- Added: litellm_config.yaml (complete model configuration)
- Added: docs/litellm_setup.md (setup documentation)
- Tested with temporary scripts (removed after validation)
