## Description

Configure LiteLLM's callback system to integrate with existing logging and metrics. This ensures we maintain visibility into model performance, costs, and errors in production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Success and failure callbacks configured
- [x] Cost tracking integrated with logs
- [x] Latency metrics captured
- [x] Secure logging (no PII in production)
- [x] Integration with existing monitoring system


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current LiteLLM provider implementation and identify integration points\n2. Research existing logging setup to understand current observability patterns\n3. Design custom callback handlers for cost tracking and latency metrics\n4. Implement LiteLLM callback configuration in provider initialization\n5. Add secure logging with PII prevention measures\n6. Integrate callbacks with existing mcp_activity logger\n7. Add environment configuration for callback controls\n8. Test callback functionality with different models and scenarios\n9. Update configuration documentation and examples
## Implementation Notes

Use LiteLLM callbacks, not custom implementation

Successfully implemented comprehensive observability and monitoring hooks for LiteLLM integration. The implementation includes:

## Key Features Implemented:
- **Custom LiteLLM Callback Handler**: ZenObservabilityHandler class that integrates with LiteLLM's callback system
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time tracking of API costs, token usage, and cumulative expenses per model
- **Latency Monitoring**: Performance metrics tracking response times and identifying bottlenecks
- **Secure Logging**: PII redaction system that automatically removes sensitive information from logs
- **MCP Activity Integration**: Seamless integration with existing mcp_activity logger

## Implementation Details:
- Created observability module with callbacks.py containing all monitoring components
- Integrated callbacks into LiteLLMProvider initialization with configurable enable/disable
- Added environment variables for granular control (OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED, OBSERVABILITY_VERBOSE, etc.)
- Implemented secure logging with automatic PII redaction (emails, phone numbers, SSNs, API keys, passwords)
- Added comprehensive error handling to prevent observability failures from affecting LLM calls

## Testing and Validation:
- Created comprehensive test suite (tests/test_observability.py) with 22 test cases covering all components
- All tests pass successfully (44/44 tests including LiteLLM provider tests)
- Validated PII redaction, cost tracking, latency monitoring, and callback integration
- Confirmed backward compatibility with existing LiteLLM provider functionality

## Documentation:
- Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive observability documentation
- Created observability/README.md with detailed implementation guide
- Added environment configuration examples for development and production
- Documented monitoring output formats and security features

## Files Modified/Created:
- observability/__init__.py - Module initialization
- observability/callbacks.py - Main callback implementation
- observability/README.md - Detailed documentation
- providers/litellm_provider.py - Added observability configuration
- tests/test_observability.py - Comprehensive test suite
- CLAUDE.md - Updated with observability documentation

The implementation provides production-ready observability while maintaining security and performance standards.
