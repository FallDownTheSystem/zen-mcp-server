## Description

Configure LiteLLM's callback system to integrate with existing logging and metrics. This ensures we maintain visibility into model performance, costs, and errors in production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Success and failure callbacks configured
- [ ] Cost tracking integrated with logs
- [ ] Latency metrics captured
- [ ] Secure logging (no PII in production)
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring system

## Implementation Notes

Use LiteLLM callbacks, not custom implementation
