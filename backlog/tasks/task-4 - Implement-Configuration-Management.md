## Description

Create environment-based configuration system that loads and validates all required API keys and application settings from environment variables only, with no config files
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Environment variables loaded from .env file or system ENV
- [ ] All required API keys validated on startup
- [ ] No configuration files used - ENV only approach
- [ ] Error handling for missing required environment variables
- [ ] Support for development and production environments
- [ ] Integration with MCP client configuration patterns
- [ ] Runtime validation of API keys and settings

## Implementation Plan

1. Review current config.js implementation to understand existing structure\n2. Enhance environment variable loading with comprehensive validation\n3. Add runtime API key validation for each provider\n4. Implement development vs production environment support\n5. Add detailed error handling for missing/invalid configuration\n6. Create configuration schema validation\n7. Add MCP client configuration pattern support\n8. Test configuration loading with various scenarios\n9. Verify error handling works correctly for missing keys
