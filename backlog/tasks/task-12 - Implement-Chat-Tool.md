## Description

Create core conversational AI functionality with continuation support that handles context processing, provider calls, and state management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Chat tool implements unified run(params) interface
- [x] Loads previous conversation history from continuation store
- [x] Processes file context images and web search input
- [x] Calls selected provider with complete message history
- [x] Saves new conversation state with generated response
- [x] Returns proper MCP response format with continuation ID
- [x] Error handling for provider failures and invalid input

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Implemented full chat tool functionality with comprehensive context processing and continuation support
- Created intelligent provider selection with auto-detection and model-to-provider mapping
- Integrated with existing contextProcessor and continuationStore utilities
- Added robust error handling and input validation throughout

### Features Implemented
- **Unified Interface**: Implements `async chatTool(args, dependencies)` with full MCP tool response format
- **Continuation Support**: Loads and saves conversation history using continuation store with UUID-based IDs
- **Context Processing**: Full file context integration with image support and web search placeholder
- **Provider Selection**: Auto-selection of available providers and intelligent model-to-provider mapping
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and graceful error handling for all failure modes
- **State Management**: Persistent conversation state with provider tracking and metadata

### Technical Decisions
- Used functional approach consistent with project architecture standards
- Integrated existing utilities (contextProcessor, continuationStore) rather than reimplementing
- Implemented intelligent model mapping (gpt->openai, grok->xai, gemini->google)
- Added comprehensive input validation and error isolation
- Used JSON response format for structured output with continuation metadata

### Files Modified/Added
- `src/tools/chat.js` - Complete chat tool implementation with full functionality
- `src/tools/index.js` - Registered chat tool in tool registry

### Integration Testing Results
- Tool successfully validates inputs and rejects invalid prompts
- Properly handles missing API key scenarios with clear error messages
- Provider selection logic works correctly for auto and specific model requests
- Continuation ID generation and management functioning as expected
- Context processing integration working with file and web search support
- Error isolation prevents failures from crashing the tool

### Known Issues/Limitations
- Web search integration is placeholder (awaiting actual search API implementation)
- Real provider testing requires valid API keys (functional testing shows proper error handling)
- Temperature and advanced provider options may need provider-specific tuning

### Tool Interface Implementation
- ✅ `chatTool(args, dependencies)` - Main tool function with dependency injection
- ✅ Input schema with required prompt and optional parameters
- ✅ MCP-compatible response format with content array and error handling
- ✅ Continuation support with persistent conversation history
- ✅ Context processing with file and image support
- ✅ Provider integration with auto-selection and model mapping

### Chat Tool Features
- **Auto Provider Selection**: Automatically selects first available provider when model='auto'
- **Model Mapping**: Intelligent mapping of model names to appropriate providers
- **Conversation History**: Persistent multi-turn conversations with continuation IDs
- **File Context**: Full integration with contextProcessor for file and image inputs
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of provider failures and invalid configurations
- **Structured Responses**: JSON-formatted responses with metadata and continuation info

### Provider Integration
- Integrates with all three providers (OpenAI, XAI, Google) through unified interface
- Checks provider availability before attempting calls
- Handles provider-specific options and response formats
- Maps model names to appropriate providers automatically
- Provides clear error messages for configuration issues
