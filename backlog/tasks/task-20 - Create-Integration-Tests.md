## Description

Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing with real MCP protocol to validate complete request/response cycles, system integration, and full Converse MCP Server functionality. **Real API keys are available in the root `.env` file for testing with actual provider APIs.** **IMPORTANT: Read backlog/docs/doc-2 and doc-3 first for project context and implementation standards.**
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration tests for full MCP request/response cycles
- [ ] Test real MCP protocol compliance with actual MCP clients
- [ ] Test tool and provider integration end-to-end
- [ ] Test continuation flow across multiple requests
- [ ] Test with real API calls using `.env` credentials for provider validation
- [ ] Mock external APIs for isolated internal integration testing
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Performance testing for parallel consensus calls
- [ ] Tests validate Converse MCP Server works as complete unit
- [ ] Full server startup shutdown and configuration testing
- [ ] Real-world usage pattern testing with actual API responses
- [ ] Comparison testing against Python Zen MCP Server functionality
- [ ] Integration tests run successfully in CI/CD environment
- [ ] Separate test suites for mocked vs real API testing
