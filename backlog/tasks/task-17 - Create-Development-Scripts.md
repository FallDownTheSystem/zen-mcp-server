## Description

Set up easy development and testing workflow with npm scripts and development server configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Development scripts added to package.json
- [x] Start script for production server
- [x] Development script with auto-restart capability
- [x] Test script configuration
- [x] Linting and formatting scripts
- [x] Build script if needed
- [x] Development server with proper logging and debugging

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Created comprehensive development workflow with 20+ npm scripts for all development scenarios
- Built specialized development server with enhanced debugging and environment validation
- Implemented production build system with validation, testing, and deployment preparation
- Added comprehensive validation script for code quality and functionality verification

### Features Implemented
- **Enhanced Package.json Scripts**: 20+ scripts covering development, testing, building, and validation workflows
- **Development Server**: Specialized dev server with environment validation, API key checking, and enhanced error handling
- **Build System**: Production build script with quality checks, artifact generation, and deployment preparation
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive validation covering environment, dependencies, code quality, and functionality
- **Environment Template**: Complete .env.example with documentation and setup instructions

### Technical Decisions
- Used Node.js --watch flag for auto-restart during development (no external dependencies needed)
- Created modular script system with separate files for build, validation, and development server
- Implemented environment-specific logging levels and configuration
- Added debug support with Node.js inspector integration
- Used native Node.js test runner for consistency

### Files Modified/Added
- `package.json` - Enhanced with 20+ development scripts covering all scenarios
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template with documentation
- `dev-server.js` - Enhanced development server with validation and debugging
- `scripts/build.js` - Production build system with validation and artifact generation
- `scripts/validate.js` - Comprehensive validation system for code quality and functionality

### Integration Testing Results
- All script imports and configurations working correctly
- Development scripts properly set environment variables and logging levels
- Script modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization
- No external dependencies required beyond existing project dependencies

### Development Scripts Implemented

#### Core Development
- `npm start` - Production server start
- `npm run dev` - Development server with debug logging
- `npm run dev:quiet` - Development server with minimal logging
- `npm run dev:verbose` - Development server with trace logging
- `npm run dev-server` - Enhanced development server with validation

#### Testing
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:providers` - Run provider-specific tests
- `npm run test:tools` - Run tool-specific tests
- `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage reporting

#### Code Quality
- `npm run lint` - ESLint validation
- `npm run lint:fix` - ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run lint:watch` - ESLint in watch mode
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check formatting without changes
- `npm run typecheck` - JavaScript syntax validation

#### Build & Deployment
- `npm run build` - Full production build with all checks
- `npm run build:fast` - Fast build skipping tests
- `npm run validate` - Comprehensive validation
- `npm run validate:fix` - Validation with auto-fix
- `npm run validate:fast` - Fast validation skipping tests/lint

#### Debugging & Utilities
- `npm run debug` - Start with Node.js inspector
- `npm run debug:break` - Start with inspector breakpoint
- `npm run clean` - Clean and reinstall dependencies
- `npm run check-deps` - Check for outdated dependencies
- `npm run security-audit` - Security vulnerability check

### Development Server Features
- **Environment Validation**: Checks for .env file and provides setup guidance
- **API Key Detection**: Shows which API keys are configured
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Development-specific error display with stack traces
- **Configuration Display**: Shows current environment, logging, and feature settings
- **Setup Guidance**: Provides helpful commands and next steps for developers

### Build System Features
- **Quality Validation**: Runs linting, formatting, and syntax checks
- **Test Execution**: Comprehensive test suite execution with reporting
- **Production Artifacts**: Generates .env.production.example and deployment instructions
- **Build Metadata**: Creates build-info.json with version, git commit, and environment info
- **Deployment Guide**: Generates DEPLOYMENT.md with production setup instructions

### Validation System Features
- **Environment Checks**: Node.js version, dependencies, file structure validation
- **Code Quality**: Syntax checking, linting, and formatting validation
- **Functionality Tests**: Unit tests, provider tests, and integration tests
- **Security Audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Report Generation**: Comprehensive validation report with success/failure tracking

### Known Issues/Limitations
- Some Windows-specific path handling in scripts (cross-platform compatibility could be enhanced)
- Build script git integration requires git to be installed and available
- Validation script timeout handling could be more robust for slow environments
