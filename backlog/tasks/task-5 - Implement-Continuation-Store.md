## Description

Create stateful conversation support with a pluggable backend using an in-memory Map with get/set/delete interface, designed for easy Redis/database replacement later

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ContinuationStore module exports get/set/delete interface
- [x] In-memory Map implementation for state storage
- [x] State persists across requests within server lifecycle
- [x] Interface designed for pluggable backend replacement
- [x] Proper error handling for invalid continuation IDs
- [x] UUID generation for new continuation IDs

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive continuation store system with pluggable backend architecture. All acceptance criteria met:

**Approach Taken:**
- Created abstract ContinuationStoreInterface base class for pluggable backend replacement
- Enhanced existing MemoryContinuationStore to extend the interface and implement all required methods
- Added comprehensive error handling with custom ContinuationStoreError class
- Replaced timestamp-based IDs with proper UUID generation using Node.js crypto.randomUUID()
- Added validation helpers and metadata tracking

**Features Implemented:**
- **Pluggable Interface**: ContinuationStoreInterface abstract class defines standard methods (get/set/delete/exists/getStats/cleanup)
- **Enhanced MemoryContinuationStore**: Extends interface with proper error handling and validation
- **UUID-based IDs**: Uses crypto.randomUUID() with 'conv_' prefix for proper unique identification
- **Validation**: ID format validation with isValidContinuationId() helper function
- **Error Handling**: Custom ContinuationStoreError with error codes and detailed messages
- **Metadata**: Tracks creation time and last accessed time for each conversation
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old conversations with configurable age limits
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive stats including memory usage and backend information

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used inheritance-based approach with abstract base class for type safety and interface consistency
- Implemented get/set/delete naming convention (instead of store/retrieve/delete) for consistency with common patterns
- Added async/await throughout for consistency even though memory operations are synchronous
- Included metadata in responses for debugging and monitoring purposes
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing helper functions (addMessageToHistory)
- Added setContinuationStore() function for testing and custom backend injection

**Interface Design for Backend Replacement:**
The pluggable architecture allows easy replacement with Redis, database, or other storage backends:
```javascript
// Easy backend replacement
import { RedisStore } from './redisStore.js';
setContinuationStore(new RedisStore(config));
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/continuationStore.js` - Complete enhancement with interface, error handling, and UUID generation
- Added ContinuationStoreInterface abstract class
- Added ContinuationStoreError custom error class  
- Enhanced MemoryContinuationStore with proper validation and error handling
- Added ID validation helpers and setContinuationStore() for backend replacement

**Integration Testing Results:**
- All get/set/delete operations working correctly with proper error handling
- UUID generation and validation functioning as expected
- State persistence verified across multiple operations
- Error handling tested for invalid IDs, null states, and edge cases
- Memory cleanup and statistics collection working properly
- Pluggable interface ready for backend replacement

**Key Benefits:**
- **Type Safety**: Abstract interface ensures all backends implement required methods
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes from invalid data
- **Monitoring**: Built-in statistics and metadata for operational visibility
- **Scalability**: Easy to replace with Redis/database when needed
- **Testing**: Injectable store backend for unit testing
- **Security**: UUID-based IDs prevent continuation ID guessing attacks
