## Description

Create tests that verify the LiteLLM provider works correctly. Focus on mocking LiteLLM responses rather than making real API calls. Ensure critical features like temperature constraints and model resolution are tested.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for LiteLLMProvider class created
- [ ] Mock LiteLLM responses for testing
- [ ] Integration smoke test with real API call (inexpensive model)
- [ ] Rate limit error handling verified
- [ ] Streaming response tests pass

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing test structure and LiteLLM provider implementation
2. Create comprehensive unit tests for LiteLLMProvider class
3. Mock LiteLLM responses for all test scenarios
4. Add timeout-specific test cases for consensus tool integration
5. Create integration smoke test with inexpensive model
6. Test error handling for rate limits and API failures
7. Add streaming response tests
8. Update or remove conflicting legacy provider tests
9. Run full test suite and fix any failing tests
## Implementation Notes

Use LiteLLM's mock capabilities when available. Include one real API call test to catch breaking changes or auth issues. Use pytest monkeypatch for mocking. Test rate limit handling by simulating 429 errors.

**Timeout-Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test consensus tool timeout parameter passing through LiteLLMProvider
- Mock timeout exceptions from LiteLLM and verify proper error handling
- Test that CONSENSUS_MODEL_TIMEOUT environment variable is respected
- Verify timeout behavior in consensus tool parallel model execution
- Test that timeouts don't trigger retry loops (as fixed in commit e6fdb74)
- Add test cases for timeout hierarchy: tool > config > defaults

## Progress Update - 2025-07-15

Successfully created comprehensive tests for LiteLLM integration.

**Work completed:**
- Updated existing test_litellm_provider.py with additional test coverage:
  - Added tests for image handling
  - Added tests for streaming (documented as not implemented)
  - Added tests for rate limit and timeout error handling
  - Added tests for all supported parameters
  - Fixed test issues related to missing methods
  
- Created test_litellm_consensus_timeout.py with timeout-specific tests:
  - Tests that consensus tool passes timeout to LiteLLM
  - Tests timeout from CONSENSUS_MODEL_TIMEOUT env var
  - Tests graceful handling of timeout errors
  - Tests no retry on timeout (as per commit e6fdb74)
  - Tests parallel execution with individual timeouts
  
- Created test_litellm_integration_smoke.py for real API tests:
  - Simple completion test with cheapest available model
  - Async completion test
  - Model validation test
  - Token counting test
  - Auth error handling test
  - Model alias resolution test
  - Concurrent requests test
  
- Fixed test infrastructure issues:
  - Updated conftest.py to use LiteLLMProvider instead of individual providers
  - Fixed test_auto_mode_provider_selection.py to work with unified provider
  - Fixed test_custom_provider.py configure_providers tests
  - Updated test_auto_mode.py to handle LiteLLM error messages
  
- Code Quality Fixes:
  - Fixed linting issues (blank lines with whitespace, unused variables)
  - Fixed platform-specific test issues (Linux path tests on Windows)
  - Fixed path separator handling in integration tests
  
- Fixed failing tests:
  - Updated consensus timeout tests to handle JSON serialization errors from MagicMock
  - Skipped provider routing tests that were specific to old architecture
  - Updated provider registry test to use LiteLLM as CUSTOM provider
  - Skipped O3 routing test specific to OpenAI provider
  - Fixed file path validation test to be platform-aware
  
## Final Results

All unit tests now pass successfully:
- 525 tests passed
- 8 tests skipped (mostly provider-specific tests not needed with LiteLLM)
- 17 tests deselected (integration tests requiring API keys)

The test suite is fully functional with the LiteLLM integration.
