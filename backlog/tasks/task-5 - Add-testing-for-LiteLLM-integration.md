## Description

Create tests that verify the LiteLLM provider works correctly. Focus on mocking LiteLLM responses rather than making real API calls. Ensure critical features like temperature constraints and model resolution are tested.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for LiteLLMProvider class created
- [ ] Mock LiteLLM responses for testing
- [ ] Integration smoke test with real API call (inexpensive model)
- [ ] Rate limit error handling verified
- [ ] Streaming response tests pass

## Implementation Notes

Use LiteLLM's mock capabilities when available. Include one real API call test to catch breaking changes or auth issues. Use pytest monkeypatch for mocking. Test rate limit handling by simulating 429 errors.
