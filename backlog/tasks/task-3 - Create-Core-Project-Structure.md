## Description

Establish the modular architecture foundation by creating the directory structure and placeholder files for the functional, module-driven architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Main server entry point (src/index.js) created
- [x] Configuration module (src/config.js) created
- [x] Central request dispatcher (src/router.js) created
- [x] State management module (src/continuationStore.js) created
- [x] Provider registry structure (src/providers/) created
- [x] Tool registry structure (src/tools/) created
- [x] Context processing utility (src/utils/) created
- [x] All modules follow functional architecture pattern

## Implementation Plan

1. Review the project architecture from doc-2 to understand module structure\n2. Create main server entry point with MCP server setup\n3. Create configuration module for environment variables\n4. Create central router for request dispatching\n5. Create continuation store for state management\n6. Set up provider registry structure with index file\n7. Set up tool registry structure with index file\n8. Create context processing utilities\n9. Ensure all modules follow functional architecture patterns\n10. Test module imports and basic structure

## Implementation Notes

Successfully created core project structure with functional architecture. All acceptance criteria met:\n\n**Approach Taken:**\n- Created modular architecture following the functional design patterns from doc-2\n- Implemented dependency injection through router for clean separation of concerns\n- Set up placeholder implementations for providers and tools to be completed in subsequent tasks\n- Used modern Node.js patterns with ESM imports and async/await\n\n**Features Implemented:**\n- Main server entry point (src/index.js) with MCP server setup and graceful shutdown\n- Configuration module (src/config.js) with environment variable loading and validation\n- Central router (src/router.js) with tool registration and request dispatching\n- Continuation store (src/continuationStore.js) with in-memory state management and cleanup\n- Provider registry structure with unified interface validation\n- Tool registry structure with MCP-compatible response helpers\n- Context processor utilities for file and image processing\n- All modules follow functional architecture patterns with explicit dependencies\n\n**Technical Decisions:**\n- Used dependency injection pattern for clean testability and modularity\n- Implemented pluggable continuation store that can be swapped for Redis/database later\n- Created unified provider interface for consistent API across all AI providers\n- Set up comprehensive file context processing supporting text and image files\n- Used singleton pattern for continuation store with automatic cleanup\n- Configured ESLint to ignore unused parameters with underscore prefix for placeholder functions\n\n**Files Created:**\n- src/index.js - Main MCP server entry point with graceful shutdown\n- src/config.js - Environment configuration with API key validation\n- src/router.js - Central request dispatcher with tool registration\n- src/continuationStore.js - Pluggable state management with memory cleanup\n- src/providers/index.js - Provider registry with interface validation\n- src/providers/openai.js - OpenAI provider placeholder\n- src/providers/xai.js - XAI provider placeholder\n- src/providers/google.js - Google provider placeholder\n- src/tools/index.js - Tool registry with MCP response helpers\n- src/tools/chat.js - Chat tool placeholder with schema\n- src/tools/consensus.js - Consensus tool placeholder with schema\n- src/utils/contextProcessor.js - File and image context processing utilities\n\n**Verification:**\n- All modules import successfully without errors\n- ESLint passes with clean code style\n- Functional architecture patterns implemented throughout\n- Dependency injection working correctly\n- Store cleanup and statistics functioning\n- Ready for provider and tool implementations in subsequent tasks
