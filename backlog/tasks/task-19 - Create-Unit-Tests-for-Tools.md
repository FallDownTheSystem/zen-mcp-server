## Description

Verify tool logic with mocked dependencies AND full integration testing by testing chat and consensus tools with various input scenarios, continuation flows, and running MCP server. **IMPORTANT: Read backlog/docs/doc-2 and doc-3 first for project context and implementation standards.**
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for both chat and consensus tools
- [ ] Mock continuation store and provider dependencies
- [ ] Test various input scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Test continuation flow and state management
- [ ] Test context processing integration
- [ ] Test error handling for tool failures
- [ ] Verify MCP response format compliance
- [ ] Full integration tests with running MCP server
- [ ] Test tools through complete MCP protocol workflow
- [ ] Test real provider integration in tools
- [ ] Tests achieve good code coverage for tool logic
- [ ] Integration tests validate tool functionality end-to-end
