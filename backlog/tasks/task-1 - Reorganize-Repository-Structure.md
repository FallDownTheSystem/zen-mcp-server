## Description

Create clean separation between Python and Node.js implementations by moving existing Python code to a dedicated directory and establishing the Converse MCP Server project structure. **IMPORTANT: Read backlog/docs/doc-2 - Converse-MCP-Server---Project-Context.md first for full project context and architecture.**
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Python files moved to python/ directory
- [ ] Node.js project directory node/ created
- [ ] Repository structure clearly separates implementations
- [ ] Python implementation remains functional as reference
