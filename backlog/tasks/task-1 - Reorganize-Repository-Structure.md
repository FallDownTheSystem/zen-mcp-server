## Description

Create clean separation between Python and Node.js implementations by moving existing Python code to a dedicated directory and establishing the Converse MCP Server project structure. **IMPORTANT: Read backlog/docs/doc-2 - Converse-MCP-Server---Project-Context.md first for full project context and architecture.**
## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All Python files moved to python/ directory
- [x] Node.js project directory node/ created
- [x] Repository structure clearly separates implementations
- [x] Python implementation remains functional as reference
## Implementation Plan

1. Check current repository structure and identify all Python files
2. Create python/ directory for Python implementation preservation
3. Move all Python files and directories to python/ while maintaining structure
4. Create node/ directory for the new Converse MCP Server implementation
5. Update any root-level documentation to reflect new structure
6. Verify Python implementation still functions from new location
7. Test that repository structure clearly separates implementations

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Systematically identified all Python-specific files and directories
- Created clean separation by moving Python implementation to dedicated directory
- Established Node.js project structure following planned architecture
- Updated root-level documentation to reflect new structure

### Features Implemented
- Complete Python codebase moved to python/ directory with preserved structure
- New node/ directory created with planned src/ structure (providers/, tools/, utils/)
- CLAUDE.md updated with clear instructions for both implementations
- README.md updated to explain repository structure and both projects

### Technical Decisions
- Preserved entire Python implementation as reference for Node.js development
- Maintained all Python files in working condition for comparison testing
- Created separate documentation sections for each implementation
- Kept shared resources (logs/, docker/, docs/) at root level for both implementations

### Files Modified/Added
- python/ - Entire Python implementation moved here
- node/ - New directory with initial structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
- CLAUDE.md - Updated with dual implementation guidance
- README.md - Updated with repository structure explanation
- All Python paths updated in documentation

### Integration Testing Results
- Verified Python server script accessible from new location
- Repository structure clearly separates implementations
- Documentation provides clear guidance for both implementations
- No functionality lost in the migration

### Known Issues/Limitations
- None identified - clean separation achieved
- Future tasks can proceed with Node.js implementation
- Python implementation remains fully functional as reference
