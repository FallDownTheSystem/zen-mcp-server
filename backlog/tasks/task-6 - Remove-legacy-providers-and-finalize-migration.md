## Description

Remove all the old provider implementations and clean up the codebase. Ensure the system is fully migrated to LiteLLM with proper documentation updates. This completes the migration from custom providers to LiteLLM.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Feature parity checklist completed (streaming, errors, costs, metrics)
- [x] All legacy provider files removed
- [x] Provider registry simplified to use only LiteLLM
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture
- [x] All tests pass with new implementation
- [x] Security scan for new dependencies passes


## Implementation Plan

1. Create feature parity checklist and validate LiteLLM implementation
2. Identify and backup all legacy provider files to be removed
3. Update provider registry to remove all references to legacy providers
4. Remove legacy provider files while preserving base.py interface
5. Clean up imports and references throughout the codebase
6. Run comprehensive tests to ensure no regressions
7. Update documentation (CLAUDE.md, README, etc.) to reflect new architecture
8. Add security scanning for new dependencies (pip-audit/safety)
9. Validate all tools work correctly with final implementation
## Implementation Notes

Keep backups until fully validated. Run feature parity checklist before deleting any code. Add pip-audit or safety to CI pipeline for dependency scanning. Update CLAUDE.md with new simplified workflow.

Successfully completed the migration from legacy providers to LiteLLM unified provider system. All legacy provider files have been removed and the system now uses a single LiteLLMProvider for all model access. The migration maintains full backward compatibility while simplifying the architecture significantly.
