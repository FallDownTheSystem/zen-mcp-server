## Description

Ensure provider implementations work correctly by creating comprehensive unit tests with mocked SDK calls AND full integration tests with running MCP server. **IMPORTANT: Read backlog/docs/doc-2 and doc-3 first for project context and implementation standards.**
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all provider implementations (OpenAI XAI Google)
- [ ] Mock external SDK calls for isolated testing
- [ ] Test successful response normalization
- [ ] Test error handling and API failures
- [ ] Test different model configurations
- [ ] Test provider interface consistency
- [ ] Full integration tests with running MCP server
- [ ] Real provider API calls tested in integration environment
- [ ] Code coverage for all provider methods
- [ ] Tests run successfully with npm test
- [ ] Integration tests validate full MCP protocol workflow
