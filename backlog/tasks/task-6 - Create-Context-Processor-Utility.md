## Description

Implement unified handling of files, images, and web search context processing using Node.js built-in modules with placeholders for advanced features

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Context processor handles file reading from absolute paths
- [x] Image processing support (placeholder for advanced features)
- [x] Web search context integration (placeholder)
- [x] Uses Node.js built-in fs/promises for file operations
- [x] Error handling for invalid file paths or missing files
- [x] Unified interface for all context types
- [x] Security validation for file access

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive context processor utility with unified interface for files, images, and web search. All acceptance criteria met:

**Approach Taken:**
- Enhanced existing context processor with unified interface design
- Added comprehensive security validation using Node.js built-in modules
- Implemented placeholders for advanced features (image processing, web search)
- Used functional architecture with detailed error handling and metadata tracking
- Added extensive validation and security checks for file access

**Features Implemented:**
- **File Processing**: Handles absolute/relative paths with comprehensive validation
- **Security Validation**: Path validation with allowed directories and access checks
- **Image Processing**: Base64 encoding with placeholders for advanced features (resizing, EXIF, analysis)
- **Web Search Placeholder**: Complete interface structure ready for API integration
- **Unified Interface**: Single `processUnifiedContext()` function for all context types
- **Error Handling**: Custom `ContextProcessorError` with detailed error codes and messages
- **Metadata Tracking**: File size, modification time, encoding, line/character counts
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel processing with error isolation using Promise.allSettled

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used Node.js built-in `fs/promises`, `path`, and `crypto` modules exclusively
- Implemented security-first approach with path validation and directory restrictions
- Added comprehensive error isolation - individual file failures don't block other processing
- Used placeholder pattern for future enhancements (image analysis, web search APIs)
- Included rich metadata for debugging and monitoring purposes
- Supported both absolute and relative path inputs with automatic resolution

**Unified Interface Design:**
The processor provides three main access patterns:
```javascript
// Individual file processing
const result = await processFileContent('/path/to/file.txt');

// Batch processing
const results = await processMultipleFiles(['/file1.txt', '/file2.js']);

// Unified context processing
const context = await processUnifiedContext({
  files: ['/path/to/files'],
  images: ['/path/to/images'], 
  webSearch: 'search query'
});
```

**Security Features:**
- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Configurable allowed directories for file access
- File existence and readability checks
- File type validation against supported extensions
- Size limits for text files (1MB) and images (10MB) with configuration options

**Placeholder Implementations:**
- **Image Processing**: Base64 encoding ready, placeholders for resizing, EXIF extraction, AI analysis
- **Web Search**: Complete interface structure ready for Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo API integration
- **Advanced Features**: Extensible design allows easy addition of new processing capabilities

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/contextProcessor.js` - Complete enhancement with unified interface
- Added `ContextProcessorError` custom error class
- Added security validation with `validateFilePath()` function
- Added unified processing with `processUnifiedContext()` function
- Added web search placeholder with `processWebSearchContext()` function
- Enhanced file context creation with metadata support
- Added utility functions for extension support and file type checking

**Integration Testing Results:**
- All file processing types working correctly (text, image, error cases)
- Security validation preventing unauthorized file access
- Batch processing with proper error isolation
- Context message creation with metadata inclusion
- Unified interface handling all context types correctly
- Web search placeholder ready for future API integration
- Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases

**Key Benefits:**
- **Security**: Path validation prevents common file access vulnerabilities
- **Flexibility**: Unified interface supports all context types with consistent API
- **Extensibility**: Placeholder pattern allows easy addition of new features
- **Reliability**: Error isolation ensures individual failures don't break entire processing
- **Monitoring**: Rich metadata and error reporting for operational visibility
- **Performance**: Parallel processing for multiple files with Promise.allSettled
- **Maintainability**: Uses only Node.js built-ins for minimal dependencies
